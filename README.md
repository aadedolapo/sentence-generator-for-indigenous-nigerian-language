# sentence-generator-for-indigenous-nigerian-language
## Project Brief
This is a Yoruba proverb generator app. The model takes in a keyword or phrase in Yoruba language and generates a proverb in Yoruba language from the given keyword/phrase. Using the keras tokenizer to generate tokens and a Sequential model by adding an embedding layer and a bidirectional LSTM model. We also took into consideration, homonymns and language intonations to help the model generate a more readable proverb. In addition, using the deep-translator library, we added google translator API to help translate the generated Yoruba proverb to English Language for non-yoruba readers.
